# mtg-library
This is a searchable library for personal/community Magic the Gathering card collections.

## Goals

The goals of this project are as follows:
* Manually create database of personal MtG cards
* Allow searching through database
* Connect to Scryfall API to automatically populate card information
* Introduce "library" functionality, allowing cards to be checked in/out by community members
